Approach
Our crisis management framework deployed real-time monitoring when an influencer's experiment showing oil separation in a frozen dessert product went viral. We tracked engagement metrics hourly, analyzing comment volume, sentiment trajectories, and reach amplification through influencer networks. By monitoring commenter follower counts and engagement patterns, we identified virality inflection points and measured exposure across demographic segments. Our AI-powered sentiment analysis distinguished between brand perception and content creator perception, revealing crucial nuance in consumer reactions that helped shape response strategy.
Analysis
Virality Tracking: Mapped the precise progression of content spread, identifying two critical acceleration periods that correlated with high-profile commenter engagement.
Aspect based Sentiment Mapping: Distinguished between criticism of product quality vs Brand vs. awareness of product classification ("frozen dessert" vs. "ice cream").
Competitive Landscape Mapping: Identified shifting consumer preferences toward alternative brands mentioned positively in 74% of comparative comments.
Demographic Analysis: Map exposure penetration of audience at state and regional level. Attribution analysis on participation gender and age.
Key Takeaways
The crisis revealed not just immediate reputation challenges but deeper consumer education opportunities. While 29% of comments expressed negative sentiment toward the brand, 71% were neutral, with many focusing on product classification rather than outright criticism. The incident exposed a knowledge gap regarding "frozen dessert" labeling that could be addressed through transparent communication.
Competitor analysis showed consumers shifting preferences toward dairy-based alternatives, with Amul being mentioned positively in 74% of comparative comments. This indicated the need for the brand to either better differentiate its product proposition or consider product reformulation.
The crisis demonstrated the critical importance of a timely response within the first 24 hours, as engagement metrics revealed a clear virality threshold occurring approximately 36 hours after initial posting. Convotrack.ai's real-time monitoring allowed for the precise identification of this critical window, enabling brands to intervene before negative sentiment reached peak amplification.
