Case Study ‚Ä¢ Consumer Insight - Mexico
Driving Nutrition & Skincare Growth through Data-Driven Engagement
Summary
A leading health and wellness company set out to optimize its product innovation and marketing strategy to achieve category leadership through data-driven segment activation and authentic consumer engagement. The objective was to decode how consumers interact across skincare and nutrition categories, while uncovering gaps in formats, functions, and messaging that could unlock growth opportunities.
By analyzing over 9,000 posts, 226K comments, and 22,910 community conversations across platforms, the study revealed a striking contrast: skincare excels in emotional storytelling and rituals, while nutrition leads with science-backed authority. Further analysis across children‚Äôs, adult, and diabetes nutrition uncovered three distinct digital ecosystems‚Äîeach with unique engagement patterns, content preferences, and influencer dynamics.
These insights provide a roadmap for innovation whitespace opportunities such as flavor-first children‚Äôs products, plant-based performance solutions for adults, and community-first engagement for diabetes care. Together, these strategies outline a clear path toward building consumer-first solutions that balance science credibility with emotional resonance.
