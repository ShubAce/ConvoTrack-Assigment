Approach
A thorough competitive analysis was conducted by examining over 8,600 videos and 33,000 posts from Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok to track the movement of global skincare trends to India. This included analyzing audience sentiment, influencer impact, and trending ingredients such as Niacinamide, Cica, and Hyaluronic Acid. Data from Google, Amazon, and Naver were also integrated to track search behavior. This approach enabled a comprehensive view of consumer preferences, trend adoption speed, and opportunities for brand positioning in Indiaâ€™s competitive market.
Analysis
Trend Cycle: Fast-Paced Movement from US to India:
Trends originating in the US showed a much quicker adoption in India compared to those from South Korea, with some trends like "Slugging" reaching India within 1 to 4 years, while others, like "Cica" took around 3-4 years.
Global skincare trends moved faster post-COVID, providing opportunities for brands to capture attention as trends emerge.
Engagement Metrics: Influence of Visual and Sensory Content:
Trends such as "Slow Aging" and "Empties Review" saw a surge in engagement due to visually appealing and sensory content, like before-and-after transformations and texture-focused videos.
Content showing real-time product usage, with relatable and authentic reviews, resonated strongly with consumers.
Competitive Benchmarking: Identifying First Movers:
D2C (Direct-to-Consumer) brands like Dot & Key and DermaCo emerged as first movers, while legacy brands like Ponds and Lakme were slower to adopt new trends.
The analysis highlighted the importance of early trend adoption and leveraging influencer partnerships to stay ahead of competitors.
Purchase Intent: Skin Type-Specific Content:
Key Takeaways
1. Trend Mapping is Essential for Brand Growth:
Brands must align their content strategy with emerging trends, ensuring they engage with consumers as new trends gain momentum. By leveraging trend-led content, brands can increase visibility and engagement in the early stages of adoption.
3. Ingredient Transparency and Education:
Transparency in ingredient sourcing and product benefits significantly drives consumer trust. Highlighting trending ingredients like Niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid, and Cica not only educates the audience but also strengthens the brandâ€™s credibility.
4. Personalization and Skin-Specific Campaigns:
As consumers increasingly seek products tailored to their skin type, skincare brands can enhance their messaging by creating skin-specific content and offering personalized recommendations backed by dermatologist insights.
5. Seasonal and Activity-Specific Campaigns:
Adapting campaigns to seasonal needs or specific activities (such as summer sunscreens or post-exercise skincare) can increase relevance and consumer engagement. Brands should continuously innovate by introducing new product formats and extensions.
