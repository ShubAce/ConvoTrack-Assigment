Approach
Within just a 2-day time window, we were able to build a social dashboard for a new client looking for ways to expand their creative ideation workshop by incorporating social data around trending content themes that resonate with their existing audience. Convotrack.ai dashboard was used to map consumption moments and cultural associations across three distinct social channels, identifying platform-specific nuances in how consumers engage with sparkling beverages. The research established clear behavioral patterns by analyzing content themes, creator personas, and engagement metrics to map the product's cultural footprint. We prioritized authentic user-generated content over brand communications to capture genuine consumption contexts, enabling the identification of untapped association spaces for future innovation and marketing opportunities.
Analysis
Emerging Consumption Occasions: Identified "dirty sodas" (mixing with cream, syrups) as a rapidly growing consumption trend, signaling consumer desire to customize beverage experiences.
Cultural Intersections: Mapped strong correlations between sparkling beverages and specific cultural touchpoints, including music (notably hip-hop collaborations), fashion moments, and sports contexts.
Cross-Platform Variations: Quantified platform-specific engagement patterns revealing TikTok's dominance in creative recipe content (16.3% of conversations) versus YouTube's emphasis on challenge-based content.
Flavor Innovation Landscape: Identified blackberry and orange cream as emerging flavor preferences gaining traction across platforms, with 9.7% of TikTok mentions highlighting these flavor innovations.
Brand Collaboration Opportunities: Pinpointed strategic collaboration potential between beverage brands and sneaker/streetwear culture, supported by 12.06% conversation overlap between these categories.
Key Takeaways
The analysis revealed that sparkling beverages are increasingly being incorporated into lifestyle moments beyond traditional consumption occasions. The strongest associations emerged around creative customization (mixing sodas with unexpected ingredients), cultural connections (particularly with hip-hop, fashion, and sports), and social sharing experiences.
The brand leveraged these insights to develop a multi-platform innovation strategy targeting three key opportunity spaces: flavor collaborations with cultural tastemakers, limited-edition packaging aligned with streetwear aesthetics, and recipe content featuring unexpected combinations. One trend in particular presented significant opportunity for product development, with data showing 9.72% of relevant TikTok content focused on creative mixing combinations using the brand's core products, suggesting untapped potential for officially branded flavor enhancement offerings.
