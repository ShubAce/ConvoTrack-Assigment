Approach
A comprehensive analysis was conducted across TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube between January‚ÄìMay 2025. Using a mix of data tracking, sentiment analysis, and performance benchmarking, 1,967 posts, 61 million engagements, and over 62,000 fan comments were studied. The approach compared branded vs tagged (fan-generated) content, identified format-specific success patterns, and decoded the influence of cast involvement on engagement. This provided an in-depth view of how different platforms reward different content strategies.
