Case Study ‚Ä¢ Protein Category Analysis - India
Decoding Protein Consumption Patterns in India
Summary
A leading food and nutrition company set out to analyze digital conversations and consumer signals across platforms to uncover protein consumption patterns, motivations, and content resonance among homemakers and broader Indian audiences (excluding gym-goers using whey protein). The objective was to identify key drivers, preferences, and winning communication themes. By studying over 2,600 top-performing posts, 84K+ community conversations, and 327M views across Instagram, YouTube, Facebook Groups, Google search, and Amazon reviews, the analysis revealed that protein has moved beyond fitness circles to become a daily household essential. The study highlights motivations around convenience, taste, and family health while exposing barriers such as integration confusion, time-crunch challenges, and flavor fatigue. These insights deliver a strategic roadmap for shaping consumer-first messaging, innovating product formats, and maximizing cultural relevance for protein adoption in India.
