Approach
Convotrack.ai implemented a comprehensive 4-step quality control process leveraging advanced Visual Analytics technology. Each influencer asset underwent automated analysis using a Mixture of Expert (AI Stack) LLM models with frame-by-frame analytics. The system assessed over 28 quality parameters, including visual elements, audio transcription, on-screen text, and brand safety guardrails. The process was designed to reduce the manual review time of 100+ hours by brand while ensuring the consistent application of brand guidelines across all influencer content with a turnaround time of just 2 hours for 100 videos. Testing the waters with 100 videos in 3 months back, the brand has quickly scaled up to 3000+ videos per month with us.
Analysis
The Visual Intelligence engine analysed multiple dimensions of influencer content:
Audio Transcription Analysis: Evaluated spoken content for language, functional benefits, sensory callouts, keywords from approved lists, ingredient mentions, and clear CTAs.
Visual Content Analysis: Assessed product visibility, pack legibility, functional benefit demonstration, sensory appeal visualization, application shots, and timing of product showcase.
Text/Caption Analysis: Examined on-screen text for product naming, benefits, ingredients, and call-to-action elements.
Brand Safety Check: Verified dress code appropriateness, language, absence of controversial content, and unauthorized brand visuals.
The system categorized each video into clear recommendation categories: "Perfect Scores - Go to Go," "Review from Brand," or "Reshoot" based on compliance with brand guidelines.
Key Takeaways
The implementation delivered significant operational efficiencies and quality improvements:
1. Rapid Assessment
Average turnaround time of under 2 hours for batches of 100 videos, compared to previously lengthy manual reviews with significant cognitive overload.
2. Ease of Implementation
The recommendations were given in easy to digest format Red (Several gaps identified), Green (Ready to be published), Amber (requiring minor tweaks). Information was shared on where the gaps were so that agencies can easily get them fixed.
3. Enhanced Quality Control
The AI-driven system assessed 22 brand-specific checkpoints plus 6 additional Convotrack-recommended parameters, providing comprehensive quality assurance.
4. Reduced Manual Review
After a 100% automated quality check, only 20% required manual verification, dramatically reducing the operational workload for the brand team.
