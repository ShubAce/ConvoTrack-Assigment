Approach
A comprehensive multi-platform analysis was conducted to benchmark digital performance across platforms. The analysis focused on:
Share of Voice (SOV) and content engagement
Influencer performance and sentiment
Audience behavior and search trends
The goal was to align content with user preferences, scale influencer impact, and develop a strategy framework for the upcoming months.
Analysis
Content Performance: What Works and What Doesn‚Äôt: Promotional content drove the highest engagement (6.7% average engagement rate), but educational content, despite lower usage (8%), performed well with a 4.4% engagement rate. Transformation-based content-though used sparingly (8%)-achieved the highest engagement at 36%. There‚Äôs an opportunity to shift focus toward educational and results-driven formats to enhance user engagement.
Platform Performance: Instagram Takes the Lead: Instagram provided the highest engagement, with branded and influencer content driving notable interactions. Facebook showed high view counts, while YouTube Shorts emerged as a powerful platform for influencer-driven content. The brand should prioritize Instagram and YouTube for future campaigns, with a focus on short-form content and engaging visual storytelling.
Search Trends: Understanding Consumer Behavior: Search trends for hair removal-related queries from Google and Amazon showed peak activity around key promotional periods like #VeetItToBelieveIt and influencer collaborations. The brand needs to use these insights to time campaigns for maximum visibility and engagement, ensuring sustained search interest beyond one-time spikes.
Key Takeaways
1. Diversify Content Types:
While promotional content is currently driving engagement, incorporating more educational and transformation-based content will build a stronger emotional connection with the audience. Allocating more budget to these content types will likely result in higher engagement.
2. Broaden Influencer Partnerships:
3. Capitalize on Short-Form Content:
Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts should be prioritized, as these formats have shown the highest engagement rates. Focusing on quick, impactful content will resonate well with modern audiences who consume content in short bursts.
4. Leverage Search Data for Campaign Timing:
Using search data from Google and Amazon to plan campaigns will help maintain brand visibility during peak interest periods. Optimizing content around these times will increase organic reach and drive higher traffic to product pages.
5. Balance Promotional and Value-Driven Content:
The brand should strike a balance between promotional content and more relatable, value-driven posts. Incorporating regional storytelling and interactive content will improve comment sentiment and foster deeper audience connections.
Conclusion
By refining content strategy, scaling influencer partnerships, and leveraging search insights, the brand can significantly improve its digital performance in the competitive hair removal market. Shifting towards more educational and transformation-focused content, expanding influencer collaborations, and capitalizing on short-form content will help the brand connect better with its audience, boost engagement, and drive sustained growth.
