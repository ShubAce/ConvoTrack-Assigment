Influencer Landscape Analysis for a Beauty Brand
Summary
A leading beauty brand set out to understand the influencer landscape over a 3-month period, with the goal of decoding influencer distribution, platform presence, and content categories across Instagram and TikTok. By analyzing 1,119 posts between March‚ÄìJune 2025, the study revealed that tutorials and transformation-led content consistently drove the highest engagement, while static promotional content underperformed. Reels and TikTok short videos proved critical for brand visibility, with nano creators delivering authentic engagement at scale. Seasonal and occasion-led storytelling emerged as a missed opportunity, especially compared to competitor activity. These insights provide a clear roadmap for beauty brands to build stronger influencer partnerships, scale tutorial-first strategies, and embed content within cultural conversations for long-term growth.

Approach

Branded vs Non-Branded Split: Assessed performance gaps between creator-driven vs brand-led content.
Analysis
Content Themes:

Transformation Content: Before-and-after and ‚Äúget-ready-with-me‚Äù formats resonated across both platforms.

UGC Strength: Consumer-generated posts and authentic routines often outperformed branded campaigns.
Engagement Metrics:
Instagram: Reels achieved 2.24% ER, static content only 0.02%.
TikTok: Non-branded creator content outperformed branded by 44% (3.9% ER vs 2.7%).
Nano Creators: Delivered higher trust and relatability, outperforming macro creators in ER.
Influencer Tier Performance:
Positive Sentiment: Positive sentiment was driven by tutorials (27%) and recommendations from relatable creators (23%).
Promotional Content: However, static, overly promotional content diluted brand storytelling and reduced authenticity.
