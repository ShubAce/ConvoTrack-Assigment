Decoding Longevity Narratives in India Through Nutrition and Social Conversations
Summary
A leading global FMCG company set out to analyze how longevity is being discussed on social media in India, with a particular focus on nutrition and orally consumed ingredients. The objective was to identify the foods and nutrients most strongly linked to longevity, uncover emerging narratives, assess consumer sentiment, and highlight opportunities for brands to engage with the growing healthy aging movement. By analyzing 1,160 posts across Instagram and YouTube between February‚ÄìJuly 2025, the study revealed that omega-3s and antioxidants dominate longevity discussions, plant-based and Blue Zone diets drive strong benefit claims, and holistic lifestyle practices outweigh quick-fix solutions. While Ayurveda continues to merge with modern clinical formats, skepticism around product efficacy persists. These insights provide a roadmap for creating consumer-first strategies that balance traditional wisdom with modern science, while addressing skepticism to build trust.
