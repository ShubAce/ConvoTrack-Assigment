Approach
A comprehensive multi-platform analysis was conducted to benchmark the brand's performance against its competitors in the sexual wellness space. This involved examining content across key platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook to assess engagement levels, content effectiveness, and influencer performance. In addition, sentiment analysis was used to understand audience perceptions, while search trends from Google and Amazon provided insights into consumer behavior and product interest. By combining these data points, the objective was to develop a more effective content strategy that would resonate with the target audience, optimize influencer partnerships, and ensure that campaigns are aligned with peak search interest periods. The ultimate goal was to refine the brand's digital strategy and enhance its engagement with consumers, leading to increased visibility and market share.
Analysis
Content Performance: What‚Äôs Resonating with Consumers: The analysis revealed that promotional content dominated the brand's strategy (72%), but lifestyle and educational content delivered the highest engagement rates, with lifestyle content achieving a 6.7% engagement rate despite being underused. The findings suggest an opportunity to shift from over-reliance on promotional content to more engaging, value-driven formats like lifestyle and educational videos that resonate deeply with audiences.
Platform Performance: Instagram Leads Engagement: Instagram emerged as the top-performing platform for the brand, with high-quality branded content driving the most engagement (17.97%). Facebook, although effective in generating reach, saw lower engagement (0.95%), while YouTube performed best for tagged content. The brand should prioritize Instagram for branded storytelling, use Facebook for broader reach, and leverage YouTube for product showcases.
Search Trends: Aligning with Consumer Intent: Google and Amazon search trends showed spikes in interest around key product launches and promotional events. The brand maintained high interest in November with the launch of a new product line and continued strong performance through January. This insight emphasizes the need for sustained visibility and timely content creation to match search volume peaks, ensuring the brand stays top of mind during key shopping periods.

Shifting content strategy to include more educational and lifestyle-driven posts will likely lead to higher engagement. These content formats build stronger connections with consumers and provide value beyond just promotional messaging.
2. Expand Influencer Partnerships:

4. Optimize Content Around Search Trends:
Aligning content release with spikes in search interest will drive higher engagement and lead to better brand visibility. Utilize search insights to time promotional pushes and product launches effectively.
5. Balance Promotional and Value-Driven Content:
The brand should diversify its promotional strategy by incorporating more value-led, emotional storytelling. This shift will help connect with a broader audience and position the brand as more relatable and authentic.
Conclusion
